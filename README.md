# Frontend Mentor Showcase

This repo contains my solutions for [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) coding challenges. Frontend Mentor is a platform that provides realistic projects for frontend developers to practice and improve their skills.

## How it works

Each challenge folder contains a `README.md` file with the challenge description, design images, and a link to the live demo. The `src` folder contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the solution. The `dist` folder contains the optimized and minified files for deployment.

## Challenges

Here is a list of the challenges that I have completed so far:

- Challenge 1: [QR-code-component](https://github.com/Aura-Subhadeep/Frontend-Mentor-Showcase/tree/main/01-QR-code-component-main)
