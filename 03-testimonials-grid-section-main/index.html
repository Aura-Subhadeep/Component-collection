          <p>I received a job offer mid-<br>course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>

          <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>
